## How do I set this up?
*An installation of* **[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)** *is required before you can successfully set this up.*
*If you don't have all dependencies installed for buildiing, please check out [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).*

1. Clone this repository.
1. Go into the newly created directory.
1. Execute `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Now execute `npm start`.
*You can also do `nodemon src/bot.js`, if you want to use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) instead of npm.*

## Do you want to submit an error?
If you'd like to add an error to our database, you can now do it easier than before. Now, to add an error; all you have to do is run `d!error <error code>` on the error code you want to submit, if that code hasn't been found yet. If the error code isn't in the database, it will be submitted to the developers.
